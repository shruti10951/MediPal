# Medipal

A Medication reminder app

MediPal stands as a user-centric medication management solution, particularly designed to address the distinct challenges faced by senior citizens and individuals contending with medication adherence difficulties. The application offers a seamless experience by enabling users to establish personalized medication schedules, receive punctual alarms, and keep track of their medication inventory, all of which collectively promote a more disciplined and organized approach to medication management. 

An innovative highlight of MediPal is its introduction of a guardian-dependent mechanism, allowing designated caregivers to remotely oversee and manage medication schedules, fostering a collaborative environment for comprehensive health management. This model not only offers reassurance to users but also extends valuable support to caregivers, resulting in a mutually beneficial relationship.
